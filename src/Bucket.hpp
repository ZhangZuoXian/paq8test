/**
 * Hash bucket, 64 bytes
 *
 * Contains bit histories (statistics only) and byte histories (byte values).
 * For every byte the bit histories are stored in the "bitState" array
 * (7 bytes) in 3 different buckets:
 * The 1st bucket: 
 *  [bit statistics for bit 0] 
 *  [bit statistics for bit 1 when bit 0 was 0] 
 *  [bit statistics for bit 1 when bit 0 was 1] 
 *  [union of byte run count and the pending flag (0xFF)]
 *  [byte value: byte in context #1 - belongs to run count]
 *  [byte value: byte in context #2]
 *  [byte value: byte in context #3]
 * The 2nd bucket:
 *  [bit statistics for bit 2]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 3 when bit 2 was 0]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 3 when bit 2 was 1]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 4 when bit 2-3 was 00]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 4 when bit 2-3 was 01]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 4 when bit 2-3 was 10]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 4 when bit 2-3 was 11]
 * The 3rd bucket:
 *  [bit statistics for bit 5]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 6 when bit 5 was 0]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 6 when bit 5 was 1]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 7 when bit 5-6 was 00]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 7 when bit 5-6 was 01]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 7 when bit 5-6 was 10]
 *  [bit statistics for bit 7 when bit 5-6 was 11]
